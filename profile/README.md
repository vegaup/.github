## Welcome to VegaUp 👋

**About Us**

🐱 We love cats and Debian

🍿 Fun fact: We eat B e a n s A n d T o a s t for breakfast

**What We Do**

We develop tools to enhance your Debian experience:

### Debian Configure Script

Our main project is a Debian configure script that automates:

- Updating Debian packages
- Installing popular applications  
- Setting up development tools

This script helps streamline the process of getting a fresh Debian installation ready for development and everyday use.

📚 Check out our [website](https://vegaup.github.io/website) to use the script.

### KittyKanvas

We've also developed a bash script that randomly changes your desktop wallpaper on every reboot, this adds a fun visual element to your desktop experience.
